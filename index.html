    <p>We are a non-profit association working towards a future with networking infrastructure that is more open and accessible to everyone. Our work focuses on the operation of open networks, such as <a href="https://thethingsnetwork.org" target="_blank">The Things Network</a>, and on the promotion of knowledge of the technologies involved via public events such as <a href="https://makezurich.ch" target="_blank">MakeZurich</a>.</p>
